<b>L-RelationalToCkan loader</b> can be used load database tables stored in internal dataunit relational database <br/>
to CKAN as CKAN datastore resource. Name of CKAN resource is the same as name of the input table.
<p/>
In order to work properly, these two parameters must be set in backend config.properties:
<ul>
	<li><b>dpu.uv-l-relationalToCkan.catalog.api.url</b> - URL of CKAN API</li>
	<li><b>dpu.uv-l-relationalToCkan.secret.token</b> - authentication token for target CKAN</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Also, prior to running this DPU, an association between pipeline and CKAN dataset must exist, otherwise DPU fails 
  
<p/>
List of options:
<ul>
	<li><b>CKAN resource name</b> - (required) Name of resource to be created in CKAN. It should not change between pipeline runs as this name
	is used as key to CKAN.
    <li><b>Overwrite existing resources</b> - (default false) if true and resource with the same name already exists in associated 
    dataset, it is overwritten. By default nothing happens if already exists, just warning message</li>
</ul>
